# Rotating Puzzle

We want to create a puzzle where we need to rotate several disks, so that the final image is reconstructed.


## Creating the disks
I'll show how to extract "disk images" using inkscape.

1. Import your image into inkscape, and drag two guides to approximately the center of the image.
2. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8543541/175748508-7ee7f906-cbcb-40da-b652-facc2c60088b.png)
3. Make some "markers"/ lines, and place them approximately where the circle should be cut. Make sure the two outer ones are placed at the largest radius, and at the center.

5. Select the "Align and distribute" option above, and you will have an equal distance between your lines.
